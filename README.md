Click the "Start" button to get started with the quick Trivia game that has a theme revolving around the anime series, Kono Subarashii Sekai no Shukufuku Wo! The user has approximately a minute to finish the trivia of six questions in total. The timer starts as soon as the user clicks the "Start" button. The user will be able to view the opening to the anime, Kono Subarashii Sekai no Shukufuku Wo!, in the background and also has a chance to see the video background change based on their results (perfect score, or anything below perfect).

## Code Explaination
Never having used radio input types, I've done a bit of research and was able to successfully utilize it for this trivia game assignment. Due to some time constraints, I've opted to go with the cleaner and single-page trivia game. Hoping to refactor at some point and add some more animations to this game.
